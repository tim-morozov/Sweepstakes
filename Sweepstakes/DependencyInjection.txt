Dependancy injection
I use dependency injection in the MarketingFirm class with the Manager object. It gets passed into the Marketing Firm constructor. When the Marketing
Firm is created the firm has the choice of which Manager it wants to use, and how to choose it, without the program forcing it to choose, based on how I wrote it.
